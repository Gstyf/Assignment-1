Instructions:
Welcome to the Team 7 Sokoban game <title pending>. The goal is to push boxes onto switches. Once all switches have a box on them you win the level. Simple?

Controls: Arrow keys to move, R to reset the level, A to immediately win and skip to next level.

You can create your own levels as well, if you think you're up to it. Inside the Resource folder there is a 'HowToCreateALeve.txt' file with instructions.

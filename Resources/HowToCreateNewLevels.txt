Textures, Level loader and this guide created by Gustaf!

When creating new levels here's what you should know,
Levels are created by pushing entities with coordinates into the levels list's array of entities. The entities are created like this:

##############
#ss#ss#      #
#     b b   ##
#bb#  # #####
#  #  # #
#p      #
#########
*
##############
#s s##      s#
#   b   b#####
# b #    #####
#   #  p     #
#            #
#####  b  b  #
    #s      s#
    ##########
*

Below is the index for reading it. Case-sensitive!
p = Player, w = Wall, b = Box, s = Switch, * = Next level


Blank spaces,  as well as any non-aforementioned characters will count as an empty coordinate. New lines will move the y-coordinate down by one unit, and character at all will move the x-coordinate right one unit. 

The editor will read the file in order, convert it to a string, and the interpret the characters in a switchcase for each character in the text document 'Levels.txt'. The program  will automatically stop adding trying to add levels when the .txt file runs out of character.

	::IMPORTANT::

Make sure that there are only one (1) player (p) on your level, or you will have problems.

Make sure you use an asterix (*) as the last character, otherwise it will not push your level into the game. :(

There should be no asterix above the first level, or you will push an empty level. Start creating you level on the next line below the asterix!

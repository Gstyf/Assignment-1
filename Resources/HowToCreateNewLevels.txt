When creating new levels here's what you should know,
Levels are created by pushing entities with coordinates into the levels list's array of entities. The entities are created like this:

##############
#ss#ss#      #
#     b b   ##
#bb#  # #####
#  #  # #
#p      #
#########
*
##############
#s s##      s#
#   b   b#####
# b #    #####
#   #  p     #
#            #
#####  b  b  #
    #s      s#
    ##########
*

This is an easier way to read it.
p = Player, w = Wall, b = Box, s = Switch, * = Next level

Blank spaces,  as well as any non-aforementioned characters will count as an empty coordinate. New lines will move the y-coordinate down by one unit, and character at all will move the x-coordinate right one unit. 

The editor will read the file in order, convert it to a string, and the interpret the characters in a switchcase for each character in the text document 'Levels.txt'. The program  will automatically stop adding trying to add levels when the .txt file runs out of character.

::IMPORTANT::
Make sure you use an asterix (*) as the last character, otherwise it will not push your level into the game. :(

The player should ALWAYS be the first entity entered.

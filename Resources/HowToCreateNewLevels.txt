When creating new levels here's what you should know,
Levels are created by pushing entities with coordinates into the levels list's array of entities. The entities are created like this:

1,2,3 2,3,4 3,4,5 

They always come in three numbers separated by a comma with no spaces between.

i,x,y 

This is an easier way to read it.

i = What kind of entity it is: 1 = Player, 2 = Wall, 3 = Box, 4 = Switch

x = Where on the x axis it should be placed (this is multiplied by 64 in render)

y = Where on the y axis it should be placed (this is multiplied by 64 in render)


::IMPORTANT::
The player should ALWAYS be the first entity entered.
A new line means a new level. Whatever is entered first will be rendered first.
